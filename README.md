## Installation
  
To install, pull down the files from the repo. Then run `npm install` in the directory you would like to work in. Next you will need to be sure to run a node server on your local machine and initiate your server by running `npm start` in your CLI. Be sure that you are working in the current directory when starting your server.
  
## Usage
  
Once you have installed the app, right click on one of your files in the directory you're working in. Click "Open in Integrated Terminal". Then in your command line, type `npm start`. Then you can `Ctrl + Click` on the localhost:3001 link provided in your CLI. This will take you to the homepage. Click the "Get Started" button to go to the notes page.

Here you will see existing notes on the left side of the dashboard. On the right side you can enter a new note with a title as well as text for your note. Once you've entered your note, click the save icon on the upper right corner to save the note. 

You can click on each note on the left side to open the note and view the text. If you'd like to create a new note, simply click the plus icon at the top right. 

To delete an existing note, click the trash can symbol to the right of the note that you would like to delete.
